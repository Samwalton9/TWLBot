# TWLBot
Wikimedia bot for updating various Wikipedia Library pages

# Usage
Designed to be run on a regular basis (e.g. once per day), updating https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:TWLJ with the latest availability data from the Library Card platform (https://wikipedialibrary.wmflabs.org/).

# TODO
This bot will be improved to also make these changes to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:The_Wikipedia_Library/Databases, perhaps also updating the descriptions, and do the same on Meta.

In the future this bot may do slightly more complex things like add new partners to that template when added to the platform.
